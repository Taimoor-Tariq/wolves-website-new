## Setup Instructions
* Install all dependancies by typing `npm i` in the terminal.
* Setup the `.env` variables (if you dont have them message @Taimoor-Tariq)
* This project uses the 'express-subdomain' package so you will have to setup some kind of port-forwarding on your computer since localhost has no subdomains.

Download [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) to easily edit the .db files. Message @Taimoor-Tariq if you need help.
